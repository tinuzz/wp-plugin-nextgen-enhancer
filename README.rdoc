= NextGEN Enhancer Wordpress Plugin

This is a Wordpress plugin, that enhances the functionality of
NextGEN Gallery [1], a great photo gallery plugin for Wordpress.

A warning up front: THIS PLUGIN IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.

It makes certain assumptions about how your content is organised,
and it makes changes to your NextGEN Gallery database, although
it is configurable in many ways, and is relatively safe to use.

It was developed on a 'works for me' basis, initially to get rid
of a growing collection of patches on NextGEN Gallery, that made
upgrading a drag, over and over again. This is now over :-)

== Features

This plugin has the following features:

* Retaining meta-data.
  If you use NextGEN Gallery with GD for image manipulation, image meta-data
  (EXIF) is lost after -for example- resizing. NextGEN Enhancer uses a perl
  program named `exiftool' to save the meta-data to a file (XMP format), and
  restore the data in the image file after manipulation. The XMP file can
  optionally be kept for future reference.

* Automatic management of image descriptions.
  NextGEN Gallery provides a 'description' field for each image, in which you
  can manually describe your image. NextGEN Enhancer introduces a way to
  automatically manage the description field from various sources of information.
  For this purpose, it creates its own database table, in which the actual
  caption of image, as well as other information like copyrights are stored.
  Using a template, the description of the image can be assembled from this
  information and from an image's meta-data. Automatic management of the
  description field can be switched on or off for each image separately.

* Video support. NextGEN Enhancer can automatically detect video files by
  matching the filename against a regular expression. For video files, it
  can import some properties (only width/height and mtime for now)
  from a separate XML file, and store those in the database. When viewing a
  gallery, video files can be viewed with your favorite flash player like JW
  Player or Flowplayer. If you have one of these players installed through a
  WP plugin, configuration of this feature is really easy.

* Page pre- and suffixes. NextGEN Enhancer lets you create a WP page for
  showing a gallery. NextGEN Enhancer lets you specify a prefix and a suffix,
  that will be automatically added to the gallery page. This works nicely,
  for example when protecting your pages with Hidepost [2].

* (Experimental) Tzzbox overlay effect. NextGEN Enhancer comes with its own
  Lightbox alternative. When enabled, the JavaScript Thumbnail effect setting of
  NextGEN Gallery is overridden.

* (Experimental) A shortcode [nggenav] for quick navigation between album pages.

=== Retaining meta-data

To turn this option on, check the option 'Retain EXIF data with exiftool' on
the options page. You will have to specify the path to `exiftool', too. The
default path is <tt>/usr/bin/exiftool</tt>, which is suitable for Debian/Ubuntu
if you have <tt>libimage-exiftool-perl</tt> installed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: this currently only works for importing new images. For image
operations like resizing, the meta-data is NOT written back to the image, due
to a bug in NextGEN Gallery. See [6] for more information.

=== Automatic management of image descriptions

This is the most complex feature of NextGEN Enhancer and it is turned off by
default. To make use of this feature, you should take the following steps:

1. Check and set the default copyright message on the options page. This
   will be set on every image that is put under NextGEN Enhancer's control. Its
   use is optional, but more on that under 4. It is in strftime() format,
   so you can use placeholders that will be replaced by date/time information.
2. Decide if you want to use this feature globally, for every image in every
   gallery. If you do, proceed with 3, otherwise, go to 7.
3. Check the option named 'Automatically manage NextGEN's description field' on
   the options page.
4. The options page provides two templates, one for images and one for videos.
   Check if the template for images is to your liking. For example, if you don't
   care about copyrights, remove it from the template.
5. (Optional) Prime NextGEN Enhancer's database table with the button at the bottom
   of the options page. This will create a record for every image in every one
   of your galleries, set the copyright to what you specified before and copy the
   'description' field from NextGEN Gallery's database to the 'caption' field of
   NextGEN Enhancer. No changes are made to your NextGEN Gallery database.
6. Globally update the descriptions of all images in your dabase. This WILL make
   changes in your NextGEN Gallery database; that's why this is a separate step.
   You can do this by clicking the 'Globally update descriptions' button on the
   options page. A means of doing this on a per-gallery basis is provided under 8.
7. (Optional) When managing a gallery, there is a new checkbox in the rightmost
   column named 'NextGEN Enhancer enabled'. If this is checked, it means a
   record for that particular image is present in NextGEN Enhancer's table, and
   automatic description management is available for that image. Using the
   checkbox in the table header, you can (de)select all images at once. Save your
   changes to add or remove images from NextGEN Enhancer's care.
8. If you have automatic management enabled globally, NextGEN Enhancer will
   update the description field of the image every time you save your changes.
   If you chose to leave this feature disabled, you can select images by checking
   their checkbox, and under 'Bulk actions', choose 'Update description with
   NextGEN Enhancer'.

=== Video support

This feature is the one that has the most prerequisites before it might become
of use to you. To turn this option on, check the 'Video support' checkbox on
the options page. It is turned off by default.

With this feature, NextGEN Enhancer will check the filename of each new image
that is imported into NextGEN Gallery against a regular expression that you can
provide. If the filename matches, the file is considered to be the preview
image of a video file. This means a couple of things:

* In the 'extended' album view, the number of images and videos is reported
  separately, instead of just one number of items. WARNING: this currently
  only works when your language is English, or any other language where the
  album view displays the word 'Photos' with the number for each gallery.
* For each matching file, the link for the thumbnail when viewing a gallery
  will point at the .swf of a flash video player, that you can set using the
  'HTML reference to Flash video player' option. This has been tested with
  JW Player [3] and Flowplayer [4], but only using Lightview [5] or the 'Tzzbox'
  overlay effect that comes with this plugin to view the gallery, so this may
  or may not work for you at all.
* For matching files, an XML file is read for video meta-data. At this point,
  only width and height are imported. This information can be used to instruct
  your Lightview/Lightbox/Shadowbox viewer which size to open the video.

The following has to be taken into account:

* Only tested with Lightview and Tzzbox. Other lightbox clones almost guaranteed
  not to work.
* Your filenames have to follow a certain convention:
  - say, the preview image is named 'myvideo.mp4.jpg'
  - the actual video should then be named 'myvideo.mp4' and be located in the same
    directory
  - the meta-data XML should be named 'myvideo.mp4.xml'.
* The format of the XML file is fixed for now. This should change in the future.
* For both Lightview and Tzzbox, the description template for videos (see options page)
  should contain the tag {lightviewoptions} at the end. This tag will make sure that
  the description is formatted, so that Lightview/Tzzbox knows the dimensions of the
  video.

The XML format is as follows:

 <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
 <fileset>
 <flv>
 <height>{HEIGHT}</height>
 <width>{WIDTH}</width>
 <mtime>{MTIME}</mtime>
 </flv>
 </fileset>

=== Tzzbox overlay effect (experimental)

NextGEN Enhancer comes with 'Tzzbox', a Lightbox-like effect, based on jQuery
TOOLS [7] and written by the same author as NextGEN Enhancer. It was inspired
by Lightview, but has far less features. Basically, it can only display images
and Flash as of now, but at least support for HTML5 video is on the roadmap.

The JavaScript for jQuery TOOLS 'Overlay', 'Expose' and 'Flashembed' is included
in the library, so if you have these tools loaded by some other means in your
Wordpress install, the tools might be loaded twice, which may cause problems.
The only workaround at this moment, is to edit 'tzzbox.js', find the line that
contains 'jQuery Tools v1.2.6 - The missing UI library for the Web', and delete
everything from that line onward.

=== Album navigation shortcode (experimental)

A shortcode [nggenav] allows you to quickly set up a navigation bar for album
pages. If you, like me, have many album pages with similar names, for example
'Photos 2012', 'Photos 2011', 'Photo specials', etc. it may be convenient to
automatically have links to all other albums on every album page.

This shortcode fetches all pages that have a meta-key named 'ngg_album' and
creates a series of links out of them. A regular expression search-and-replace
is done on the page titles, so you can strip off certain words. For example,
if your pages are named like mine, you could strip off the word 'Photos' and
just keep the year.

At the moment, the search-and-replace patterns, as well as the link separator
( | ) can only be changed in the code, but they will be turned into settings
soon.

The meta-key 'ngg_album' has to be added to the appropriate pages by hand via
the 'Edit page' screen, in the 'Custom Fields' section. If this section is not
visible, you can enable it via 'Screen Options', in the top-right corner of
the screen. The value of the key does not matter.

The links are sorted by page title in descending order by default, but you can
influence this by changing the 'Order' attribute of the page. You can set a
negative order to move a link to the start of the list.
