== Description ==

This plugin enhances the functionality of NextGEN Gallery. Its features:

* Retaining meta-data across image operations, like resizing.
* Automatic management of image descriptions, using various sources of information.
* Video support in galleries. Videos can be played with your favorite flash
  player. No HTML5 yet.
* Page pre- and suffixes for gallery pages. Useful with Hidepost, for example.
* Tzzbox overlay effect, because Lightshadowboxviewclone just isn't good enough.

It needs NextGEN Gallery version 1.9.0 or higher.

A warning up front: THIS PLUGIN IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.

It makes certain assumptions about how your content is organised, and it makes
changes to your NextGEN Gallery database, although it is configurable in many
ways, and is relatively safe to use.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole `nextgen-enhancer` directory and its contents
   to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How safe is it to use this plugin? =

It is relatively safe. Features that modify your NextGEN Gallery database have
to be enabled explicitly, and even then, it is hard to make unwanted modifications
by mistake. However, creating a database backup before enabling this plugin is
always a good idea, and once you start using the plugin, the modifications are
irreversible.
